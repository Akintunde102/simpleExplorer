### Build (advanced)

Museeks is built upon:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron/) (formerly atom-shell)
* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as UI library and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) as data-flow pattern

Requirements:

- `node` > 10
- `npm` > 6

Please consider that **`master` is unstable**.

- `git clone git@github.com:martpie/museeks.git`
- `cd museeks`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build` or `npm run dev`
- `npm run museeks` or `npm run museeks:debug`

## Troubleshooting

Museeks is currently in development. This implies some things can break after an update (database schemes changes, config...).

If you encounter freezes or crashes when using the app, you can reset Museeks by following these steps:

- Go to the Museeks folder directory
    - Windows: `%AppData%\museeks`
    - OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/museeks`
    - Linux: `~/.config/museeks/` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/museeks`
- Delete:
    - `IndexedDB` folder
    - `config.json` file
- Restart Museeks

If you still get problems after that, please open an issue :)

## Bug report

If you want to report a bug, first, thanks a lot, that helps us a lot. Please open an issue and mention your OS, your Museeks version, and how to reproduce it. Adding a screen of the console (Menu -> View -> Toggle Developer Tools) is a big help too.

## Contribute

- Fork and clone
- Master may be unstable, checkout to a tag to have a stable state of the app
- `npm install && npm run dev` then run in a separate terminal `npm run museeks:debug`
- `npm run dev` will watch for file changes using Webpack which will recompile JSX and CSS files.

Please respect a few rules:

- Before making complex stuff, don't hesitate to open an issue first to discuss about it ;)
- Make the code readable and comment if needed
- Make sure your build pass

Then open a PR :)
